## Jupyter Shelf

If you are using Jupyter notebooks extensively and need a convenient way to use virtual environments with the notebooks, Shelf may be suitable for you.

Shelf allows you create a virtual environment and use it with a set of notebooks in a Jupyter lab environment, hence the name shelf.

It is easy to create and dispose shelves. Shelf can help your organize your workspace and notebooks.

### Why Shelf was needed

I use Jupyter notebooks to for a wide range of tasks ranging from testing python libraries&tools to training&testing language models. Most of the time testing requires a different python environment. I always needed to Jupyter notebooks with use virtual environments. You need to run several commands to create a kernel from a virtual environment and then you can use the kernel within the jupyter lab. This manual approach kept me away from using virtual environments. Then I developed several bash functions to alleviate the burden managing virtual environment kernels. Then I realized that I need a real solution that I can use in different environments. 1
